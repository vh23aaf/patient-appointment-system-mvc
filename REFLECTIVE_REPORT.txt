Healthcare Management System Implementation

INTRODUCTION

This report discusses how the Part 1 design artifacts have been realized in the
implemented Healthcare Management System, focusing on the application of the
Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and design patterns employed.

IMPLEMENTATION OF PART 1 DESIGNS

The class diagram from Part 1 served as the foundation for all domain entities.
The abstract UserEntity class forms the base for PatientEntity, mirroring the
inheritance structure specified in the design. Although the full clinician
hierarchy (GP, Specialist, Nurse) was designed in Part 1, the implementation
focuses on core patient management functionality, with the architecture
supporting future clinician class extensions.

The entity relationships defined in Part 1 have been preserved. PatientEntity
maintains aggregation relationships with AppointmentEntity and MedicalRecordEntity
through LinkedList collections, enabling patients to access their appointment
history and clinical records. The association between PrescriptionEntity and
PatientEntity, as well as ReferralEntity connections between clinicians, are
implemented through ID-based relationships stored in the respective entities.

Use cases from Part 1 directly influenced method implementations. The "book
appointment" use case translates to scheduleAppt() in PatientEntity, while
"create prescription" manifests in the addRx() service method. The referral
workflow, central to Part 1's design, drives the ReferralService singleton
implementation.

MVC ARCHITECTURAL PATTERN APPLICATION

The system strictly adheres to MVC principles through clear separation of
concerns across three distinct layers.

The MODEL layer encompasses all domain entities in the domain package. These
classes (UserEntity, PatientEntity, AppointmentEntity, PrescriptionEntity,
ReferralEntity, MedicalRecordEntity) contain business data and validation logic.
Entities use LinkedList collections for managing relationships, providing
efficient insertion and iteration. Each entity includes formatAsCSV() methods
for data persistence, keeping serialization logic within the model.

The VIEW layer consists of UI components in the ui package. AppWindow provides
the main interface with tabbed navigation for different entity types. Dialog
classes (PtDialog, ApptDialog, RxDialog, RefDialog) handle user input for CRUD
operations. The view layer contains no business logic, purely rendering data and
capturing user actions. All data manipulation requests are delegated to the
service layer, maintaining proper MVC boundaries.

The CONTROLLER layer bridges model and view through the service package.
DataService acts as the primary controller, coordinating data operations and
managing entity collections. It utilizes FileHandler for persistence operations,
abstracting file I/O from business logic. ReferralService implements the
singleton pattern for centralized referral management. Controllers handle all
data flow between view interactions and model updates.

DESIGN PATTERNS EMPLOYED

The Singleton pattern implementation for ReferralService uses lazy initialization
with synchronized access. This ensures thread-safe instantiation while delaying
object creation until first use. The pattern guarantees centralized referral
management, critical for maintaining referral workflow consistency and audit
trails.

FileHandler employs Scanner and PrintWriter for I/O operations, differing from
traditional BufferedReader/Writer approaches. This demonstrates alternative
implementation strategies while achieving the same functional requirements.

The repository pattern is implicit in DataService, which manages entity
collections and coordinates persistence through FileHandler. This abstraction
separates data access logic from business logic.

CONCLUSION

The implementation successfully translates Part 1 designs into a functional
system. MVC architecture provides maintainable code organization. The lazy
singleton pattern ensures efficient referral management. The feature-based
package organization facilitates future enhancements while maintaining clear
architectural boundaries.
